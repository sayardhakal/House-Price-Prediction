# House-Price-Prediction
This is a machine  learning project related to regression model. For this project, I have used California House Price Dataset from sklearn datasets. The dataset when fetching has irregular form of data so they are firstly converted into pandas dataframe. The dataset consists of (20640, 9) rows and column. Target variable is the median house value for California districts,\nexpressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars ($100,000). Since, it is a regression model probelm I have used XG Boost Regressor model. Below are the following process done in this project.
1. House Price Data
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Data Analysis
4. Train test split
5. XG Boost Regressor
6. Evalution
